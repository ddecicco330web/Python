Model changes in Task 2.5

Recipes
	- pic : image
	- instructions : text

I added pictures to the recipes model to show an image of the dish.
I added instructions because this will be used to explain how to make the dish.

Frontend inspirations:

I like this app's design because the design is simple and clean. For the welcome screen I like the white text over an image of some fresh food. For the list I like the cards with the image on top and text on the bottom.
