# Task
## Step 1
I used a dictionary to create the recipes because it is easy to access and modify the key values. It is also easy to add many values to a dictionary by using `extend`. Also when I print the recipe, the key will act like a label for the values printed to the screen, so it is easier to understand the data.

## Step 3
I chose a list to store the recipes because it stores data in sequential order. It is also easy to add or remove recipes in the future. You can also modify parts of the current recipes.
